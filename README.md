### About Me 
Hello! I’m a dedicated college student majoring in Psychology, with a strong interest in understanding human behavior and promoting mental wellness.
Over the course of my academic journey, I’ve developed skills in research analysis, active listening, critical thinking, and effective communication. I enjoy applying these skills to explore topics such as mental health advocacy, cognitive development, and behavioral science. I’m also gaining hands-on experience with tools like SPSS, Qualtrics, and Microsoft Office Suite.
My curious mindset, commitment to empathy and ethical practice, and passion for helping others drive me to grow both personally and professionally.
Outside of academics, I love to read and spend time at the gym—it's how I recharge and stay balanced.
Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin, or Github!

 - This project taught me about different features of laptops and monitors and to really grasp and understand the proper ways to search for technology and what to actually look for.

 - Initial project idea: 
The goal of this project was to find a website that sells new pieces of technology such as best buy and to observe the differences in prices. The problem to solve was really to see what causes certain pieces of technology to be more than others. 

Tools I used: 
I used only the website of best buy to search for the technology and then I used Excel to organize the information. I put each piece of technology into its own category. 

Challenges I faced:
Some challenges I faced with this were just trying to find certain details about the technology like sometimes I really had to search as to why something would be more expensive than others. I just overcame this by trying to learn about the different terms to look for when it comes to shopping for laptops and monitors, and I learned a lot about what to specifically look for. 

Other Resources: 
I had a partner Maeve in this project to help me and we each assigned each other different items and we searched for them on our own. 

Result:
I set out to really just learn more about technology and what pieces are better quality than others. Also, what makes a laptop or monitor specifically more expensive than others. I would improve my organization on my excel sheet for next time because it got a bit messy now that I look back on it.
