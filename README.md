### About Me 
Hello! I’m a dedicated college student majoring in Psychology, with a strong interest in understanding human behavior and promoting mental wellness.
Over the course of my academic journey, I’ve developed skills in research analysis, active listening, critical thinking, and effective communication. I enjoy applying these skills to explore topics such as mental health advocacy, cognitive development, and behavioral science. I’m also gaining hands-on experience with tools like SPSS, Qualtrics, and Microsoft Office Suite.
My curious mindset, commitment to empathy and ethical practice, and passion for helping others drive me to grow both personally and professionally.
Outside of academics, I love to read and spend time at the gym—it's how I recharge and stay balanced.
Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin, or Github!

### Projects

#### Project 1 Title
 - This project taught me about different features of laptops and monitors and to really grasp and understand the proper ways to search for technology and what to actually look for.

 - Initial project idea: 
The goal of this project was to find a website that sells new pieces of technology such as best buy and to observe the differences in prices. The problem to solve was really to see what causes certain pieces of technology to be more than others. 

Tools I used: 
I used only the website of best buy to search for the technology and then I used Excel to organize the information. I put each piece of technology into its own category. 

Challenges I faced:
Some challenges I faced with this were just trying to find certain details about the technology like sometimes I really had to search as to why something would be more expensive than others. I just overcame this by trying to learn about the different terms to look for when it comes to shopping for laptops and monitors, and I learned a lot about what to specifically look for. 

Other Resources: 
I had a partner Maeve in this project to help me and we each assigned each other different items and we searched for them on our own. 

Result:
I set out to really just learn more about technology and what pieces are better quality than others. Also, what makes a laptop or monitor specifically more expensive than others. I would improve my organization on my excel sheet for next time because it got a bit messy now that I look back on it.

#### Project 2 Title
 - This project taught me how to navigate SPSS for the first time while also learning how to organize data and the uses of different graphs.

 - Initial project idea: 
This project I came up with to get used to using the functions of SPSS. I came up with a question of experiment to ask and that further led to learning how to create graphs based on the spreadsheet. I also gathered data and learned to organize it. 

Tools I used: 
I used SPSS which is typically used to organize data and create graphs. 

Challenges I faced:
I did initially have a hard time using SPSS as it is a very old website and so it took be a little while to figure it out. I also initially had a hard time with creating the graphs as I had to learn how to organize it specifically on that website. 

Other Resources: 
I did not use any other resources or collaborations. 

Result:
I achieved a lot in terms of learning how to navigate the functions of a new website for spreadsheets that’s different from excel. For next time I would like to learn how to create the graphs in a more advanced way because I felt as though I had a hard time figuring that out.

#### Project 3 Title
 - This project allowed me to get even more practice using SPSS along with learning to upload data from another website. I was able to get more practice in making graphs along with overcoming obstacles that I did not face on the website prior to this.

 - PROJECT 3:
Initial project idea: 
This project was used to get in more practice using SPSS and to learn to upload data into the website. I also focused more on finding a specific question to solve which was the relativity to heat and the loudness of cricket noises. 

Tools I used: 
I used SPSS and data from excel which I uploaded.

Challenges I faced:
I had a really hard time trying to upload the data as this was the first time I had done it and my file names were initially incorrect. I was able to figure it out by watching videos to help me to understand what the issue was with my translation. 

Other Resources: 
The only other resource I used was videos from my professor to help me to translate and understand the issues. I did not collaborate with anyone. 

Result:
What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further? 
The goal I set out to do was to get more comfortable using SPSS and also to learn to upload data from another website which is really convenient. I think for next time I will try to collaborate with others to really understand where I’m running into issues when using SPSS.
